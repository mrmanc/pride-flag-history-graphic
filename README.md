# Pride Flag History Graphic

I created this repo to make sure the graphic was free for anyone to use and adapt. Please feel free to use the content for whatever purpose, with attribution and information about the licence included.

I created this graphic to support an article titled [This flag has no rules](https://careers.autotrader.co.uk/auto-trader-life/This-flag-has-no-rules) why Auto Trader UK followed Manchester Prideâ€™s example by adopting a pride flag with stripes to represent the LGBT+ BAME community.
